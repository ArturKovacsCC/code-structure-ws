// Task 1

// Write a function called `addStuff`, that takes two parameters, the first called `str` and a second, called `num`.
// This function should print str + str and then print num + num.
// Before executing this function, think about what it will print if we call it like this:
// addStuff("hi", 3);

// Now execute it and see if it did what you expected.




























// Task 2
// Before executing this function, think about what it will print if we call it like this:
// addStuff("hi", "asd");

// Now execute it and see if it did what you expected.






































// Task 3
// Now do it once more, with the following code:
// const str = "hi";
// addStuff(str, str);




































// Task 4
// Let’s say that a senior developer told us that we must not print anything
// inside the `addStuff` function. Let’s refactor our code such that `addStuff`
// returns a single string, and then let’s use a single `console.log` to print its return value.
